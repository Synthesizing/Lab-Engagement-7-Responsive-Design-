                    <h2 class="display-10">Why Choose Electric Vehicles?</h2>
                    <p class=>Electric vehicles (EVs) are fundamentally
                        transforming the automotive industry and the way people
                        think about transportation. Unlike traditional gas-powered
                        cars that rely on fossil fuels, EVs run on electricity, which
                        can be sourced from renewable energy like solar or wind power.
                        This shift significantly reduces harmful emissions, including
                        carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which contribute
                        to air pollution and climate change. By relying on cleaner energy,
                        EVs not only lower the carbon footprint of individual drivers but
                        also help in reducing our overall dependence on non-renewable resources.

                <div class="content col-md-6">
                    <h2 class="display-10">Benefits of Electric Vehicles</h2>
                    <p class=>Electric vehicles require less maintenance
                        compared to traditional internal combustion engine
                        cars due to their simpler design. With fewer moving parts,
                        such as the absence of an engine, transmission, or exhaust
                        system, there’s less wear and tear, reducing the need for
                        frequent repairs or replacements. Routine services like oil
                        changes or engine tune-ups are no longer necessary, contributing
                        to lower long-term upkeep costs. Additionally, EVs produce zero
                        tailpipe emissions, meaning they don’t release pollutants such
                        as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or particulate matter into
                        the air. This leads to improved air quality, making them a more
                        environmentally friendly option for cities and communities.
